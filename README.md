# Zelda-Project

This is a small project that serves to recreate the Legend of Zelda in C++

The project uses the SDL2 Library as the platform layer, and as such, this project can be 
compiled from source to other platforms such as Mac OS X and Linux. A working build for 
Mac OS X has been compiled (even though it isn't added to the bin folder). The Bin folder
contains a compiled build for windows.
